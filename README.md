ðŸ’¡ Why Design Properties Matter
Identifying design properties in a mockupâ€”such as color palettes and typographyâ€”is essential for maintaining consistency, accessibility, and brand identity across your application. It ensures that:

Components match the Figma prototype exactly.

The user interface feels cohesive and professional.

Developers and designers work from a shared visual language.

Time is saved by reducing ambiguity during implementation.
Optional Enhancements: Testing frameworks, CI/CD, deployment services (e.g., GitHub Actions, Vercel)
